          <h2><b>Motion</b></h2>
          <h3><br>I founded a fast-paced creative agency with three extremely talented videographers/photographers. <br>
            <h4>
                      Video has been one of my passions for a long time - I started making gaming videos in 2007, and I've been learning constantly since then, about everything from cinematography to motion graphics. Along the way, I picked up photography, and it's also been a big part of my life.<br><br> I was lucky enough to have led three teams of incredible videographers/photographers in <a href=innod.html>Innovative Design</a>, and I gathered three individuals from those teams with a similar drive to produce amazing content and started <b>Motion,</b> a production team to fill the dearth of high quality freelance video and photography in our community. <br><br>
                      We've gotten a lot of notoriety very quickly, and our list of clients and accomplishments has grown already beyond my initial expectations - we've shot for PricewaterhouseCoopers, we've created multiple Kickstarter campaigns, had our work featured on Mashable, Digital Trends, USA Today, and absolutely blown past crowdfunding goals for our clients.<br><br>
                    <small>We mainly shoot mirrorless - Sony a7ii, a7, Olympus OM-D E-M10, Panasonic G7, but sometimes we shoot film for photography. For inquiries, e-mail me at hello@hongye<span style="display:none"></span>xu.co.</small></h4>

        <h3><b>Brand</b></h3>
        I sat everybody down in the cafe and laid out the plan - what we'd do, what we'd shoot, how we'd manage projects, and how we'd split the pay. With everyone on board, I thought about our brand.<br><br>
          <div class="hovereffect">
            <img class=banner1 src="assets/motion1.png">
              <div class="overlay">
                <br><br><p>Picture by Sascha.</p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <br>&nbsp;
          <br><br>I wanted to create a brand that was timely, dynamic, and near universal. It's a hallmark of a good team to be adaptable and flexible; (we'd all come from different backgrounds, street vs studio photography, live action video vs animation), and our brand should be too. I wanted a typeface that could be striking, but at the same time convey a sense of dynamism. <br><br>It's for that reason that I chose Circular to be the main typeface for our logo. It's bold Circular in white with slightly negative tracking - enough to stick together as a logo, but applicable enough to anything, anywhere. The O glyphs are round enough to invoke an image of a vehicle's wheels, and as such the logotype feels dynamic.
          <br><br>
          <div class="hovereffect">
            <img class=banner1 src="assets/motion2.png">
              <div class="overlay">
                <br><br><p>Picture by Tony.</p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <br>&nbsp;
          <br>Photography direction was more freeform. While we all practiced different kinds of photography, our editing styles were similar - heavily influenced by film tones, and dabbling in black and white. No portraiture for branding - we wanted to showcase the world around us.<br><br>
