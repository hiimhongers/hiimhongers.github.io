          <h3><br>Gigster is a smart software development service, combining top developers and designers with artificial intelligence.<br>
            <h4>Over Summer '16, I worked at <a href="http://gigster.com">Gigster</a> doing some neat product stuff. Some of it is very internal - I'd be happy to talk more about these in person if you drop me a line!<br><br>
                    I was extremely excited by the opportunity to apply a smorgasbord of different skills and make a lasting impact on a rapidly growing startup (listed as one of the best to join in the country!) - most of the work I did over the summer is still in use to date.<br><br>
                    <small>Gigster is backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners, SVAngel and Y Combinator (Summer '15).<br>It was listed as one of the best early stage startups to join in the Breakout List (end of 2015).</small></h4>

          I came in as a fresh set of eyes to evaluate the internal processes of the company and how things were run - basically a product-minded problem solver.
          <br><br>To give you the short run-down, what Gigster does is source a team for software development (consisting of a product manager, a designer and one or more engineers) from a vetted pool of top-tier talent, optimized via machine learning.
          <br><br>
          I also made some cool visual assets like animations you see here, and helped trial some colour combinations as we moved to a flatter, monochrome logotype as well as gradient-based lockups.
