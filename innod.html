        <h4><span style="line-height: 1.6em">Being the resident 'video and motion graphics' guy, I produced a lot of graphics and video for club events like recruitment and our annual designathons/workshop days. Typically it involved animating flyers that were already made in Illustrator or coming up with animations of my own.<br><br>

              </div>
          </div>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Simple shapes and nicely eased animation - those were the two goals I hoped to achieve with any motion work I did for the club.<br><br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          For a year, the animations I made were the splashes on our website. Pretty neat!<br><br>

          I led three teams of 10 videographers, one each semester. We'd work on shooting and editing projects for clients throughout the semester, sometimes taking on event recaps, promotional videos, videos for club recruitment, gigs for small businesses, etc. Below is a reel of some work we did during the Fall 2015 semester (lightwriting by me!)<br><br>
