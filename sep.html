        <h4><span style="line-height: 1.6em">For the Fall semester, the prospective theme was 'disrupt' - a little gauche and a little too on the nose, considering that our representation was mainly STEM and in the tech sector. I opted to go for 'diverge' instead - deviation from the normal path was a good way to explain the idea of entrepreneurship in college; disrupt being a buzzword lacking tact and implying some sort of hegemony. <br><br>Thematically, I wanted to keep it digital feeling - there was no denying it, our fraternity was invariably tied to engineering and computing; in our goal to recruit more underclassmen, I wanted the interest of rushees to be at least subconsciously well aligned.<br><br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          The semester prior (Spring 2016) I honed in on the theme of starting up a venture, taken to its logical conclusion. Creating a startup is something explosive, something high velocity; it reminded me of a rocket launch, each one signifying a great advance in modern technology. For the semester's recruitment, I decided to adopt the phrase "Prepare for Takeoff" as the motif.<br><br>

  I put together a rush video to be played at events as well.<br><br>

Other material followed the guidelines I'd set, and was used for marketing and promotional purposes throughout the semester. I can provide more images upon request!<br>
