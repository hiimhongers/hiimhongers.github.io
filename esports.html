          <h2><b>eSports App</b></h2>
          <h3><br>I'm designing an app for League of Legends eSports because what's on the market just doesn't cut it.<br>
            <h4>
                      I've been a close follower of LoL eSports since 2012, and my favorite team is Team Solomid, who play in the North American league. Unfortunately, as much as I'd like to, I can't watch each match live, so I have to track scores and live action on apps & Twitter.<br><br>
                      However, each of the popular solutions (Strafe, Instant eSports, Yahoo eSports, theScore eSports) is pretty flawed in how they show progression of a match, instead showing post-match statistics and overviews which I can find on Reddit.<br><br>
                    <small>This is still a work in progress. I'll update this later as I make more progress on the app.</small></h4>
          <br><br></h3>
          <div class="hovereffect">
            <img class=banner1 src="assets/esportsbanner.png">
              <div class="overlay">
                <br><br><p>3-0's are actually the least entertaining scorelines. </p>
              </div>
          </div><br><br></div></div>&nbsp;<br><hr>
      <div class="col-md-8 work">
        <h3><b>Screens</b></h3>
        <h4><span style="line-height: 1.6em">Here is the main screen of the application. I started off sketching the app in my grid book, figuring out the information hierarchy.<br><br>
          When I watch a match and look at a recap, the most important pieces of information are in order: victory/defeat, kills, gold, game objectives, and then player-by-player contribution.<br><br>
          <div class="hovereffect">
            <img class=banner1 src="assets/esportsscreen.png">
              <div class="overlay">
                <br><br><p>Fancy. </p>
              </div>
          </div>&nbsp;<br><br>
          No app had a visual representation of gold over time - the difference in gold is the most accurate representation of a game is going - difference in gold contributes to item differences and hence overall team power. I decided to incorporate an Apple Health-like interface, like steps/day tracking to make tracking how a game was going easy on the eye. The areas under the line make it very easy to see at a glance how a game is going at any point in time.<br><br>
          <img class=app2 src="assets/esportscreen1.png"><br><i><small>The graphic in the back is the map of Summoner's Rift.</small></i><br><br>I'll add more screens as I get to them!<br><br>
