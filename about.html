        <h4><br>A little about me: I was born in Melbourne on a warm day in 1997.<br>Fifteen-and-a-bit years later, I moved halfway across the world to Berkeley, California for college, a wide-eyed Applied Math freshman.
        <br><br><b>"You're not a design student?"</b><br><br>
        You're right! Unfortunately Berkeley doesn't have a design major just yet, so instead I pursued my other academic interests (Math & Economics). At some point
        I was even on track for a career in finance, until I realised that <i><b>solving problems and creating meaningful experiences through crafting thoughtful products was what I really wanted to do.</b></i> There's nothing quite like making a product that delights someone, so I took whatever design-related classes
        I could get into, practiced constantly and read voraciously.<br><br> As of now, my process consists of first understanding the user and their journey, augmenting it with visuals, doing user testing, then iterating, iterating, and iterating. Human-centered design, if you will.
        <br><br>I'm also an avid videographer and motion designer. I've been shooting and editing videos for 9+ years, and founded/currently run a video and photo production team called <a href="motion.html">Motion</a>.<br><b>Some highlights:</b> working with PricewaterhouseCoopers, creating Kickstarter campaigns that have together raised over $250,000 in funding, and having work featured in publications like <a href="motion.html">Mashable, Digital Trends, USA Today, and more!</a> <br><br>As for motion design, I've been using After Effects for about 5 years, and <a href="innod.html">I teach workshops and educate videography teams on motion graphics and AE.</a><br><br>

        When I can, I enjoy writing code too! I put this site together myself (after realising how expensive Squarespace was), I've taken Berkeley's equivalent of SICP (in Python), our data structures class (in Java), and a data analysis class (R). Over summer I even messed around with NLTK and writing a Twitter bot! <br><br></h4><hr>
