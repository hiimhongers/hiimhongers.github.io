        <h4><br>A little about me: I was born in Melbourne on a warm day in 1997.<br>Fifteen-and-a-bit years later, I moved halfway across the world to Berkeley, California for college, a wide-eyed Applied Math freshman.
        <br><br><b>"You're not a design student?"</b><br><br>
        You're right! Unfortunately Berkeley doesn't have a design major just yet, so instead I pursued my other academic interests. At some point
        I was even on track for a career in finance, until I realised that <i><b>solving problems and creating meaningful experiences through crafting thoughtful products</b></i> was what I really wanted to do. There's nothing quite like making a product that delights someone, so I took whatever design-related classes
        I could get into, practiced constantly and read voraciously.
        <br><br>I'm also an avid videographer and motion designer. I've been shooting and editing videos for 9+ years, and founded/currently run a video and photo production team called <a href="motion.html">Motion</a>.<br><br><b>Some highlights:</b> working with PricewaterhouseCoopers, creating Kickstarter campaigns that have together raised over $250,000 in funding, and having work featured in publications like <a href="motion.html">Mashable, Digital Trends, USA Today, and more.</a> <br><br>

        When I can, I enjoy writing code too! I've taken Berkeley's equivalent of SICP (in Python), our data structures class (in Java), and a data analysis class (R). As for design software, I use Sketch, After Effects and Invision daily, and I'm currently learning Framer. <br><br></h4><hr>
